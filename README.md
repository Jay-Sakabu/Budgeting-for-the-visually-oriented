# Budgeting App, Brainstorming document
Managing money is harrowing, but also universal. Everyone at some point needs to do it, and many people don't know the steps to carry out in order to ensure that they have a robust budget. Things like investing, taxes, having an emergency fund, knowing how much to spend for monthly rent are all examples of non-obvious but highly important budgeting items that everyone ***should*** know. My app seeks to add peace of mind at the punching in of a few numbers and the push of a button.

## Objectives for the project
For the first phase of the project, I plan on implementing the application as a CLI app with the idea in mind that I will create functions to be used later on for a web application. 
The list is a representive but non-exhaustive set of objectives that the project should accomplish
- Save user time
- Provide a detailed budget
- Show the user how the numbers are derived
- Provide an intuitive interface, emphasizing ease of use

## LaunchCode knowledge applied
- Organization and Time Management
> Setting weekly goals will be a helpful way to ensure consistent progress is made on this application
- Values, Data Types, and Operations
> Knowing what data types to use properly will help ensure that precise and accurate figures are given to the user
- The Growth Mindset
> Accepting that there will be roadblocks along the way and coming up with methods to overcome them will guarantee that I adopt a growth centric modality.
- Stringing Characters Together
> By knowing strings, I can give users comprehensive explanations for a certain topic, maybe even implement some NLP feature so that the application feels more personal
- Control Structures and Logic
> Having solid logic will be core and provide the structure to the overall project. By having a solid flow to the application, I can provide the user with an experience that is simple and impactufl
- Working with Loops
> Using loops, I'll be able to repeat blocks of code that need to be iterated 
- Building Arrays
> In order to hold user data, I may be able to build arrays in order to hold info for them
- Using Arrays
> By using the arrays we built, we can use and manipulate the data in order to give users a streamlined experience
